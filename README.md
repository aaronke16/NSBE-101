# CampusPlace 

## Overview  
CampusPlace is a platform designed exclusively for **University Students** to buy and sell goods securely within their campus community. Inspired by Facebook Marketplace, it ensures that only verified UB students can participate, fostering a **trusted** and **safe** environment for peer-to-peer transactions.  

## Why It Exists  
- **Exclusive to UB Students**: Users must have a `@buffalo.edu` email, ensuring security and trust.

- **Safe Transactions**: Allows students to meet at specific on-campus locations for exchanges.  
- **Opportunity for Extra Income**: Provides a way for students to sell unused items and make money while in school.  

## How It Works  
1. **Sign Up** â€“ Register using your university email and verify your account.  
2. **List an Item** â€“ Upload images, set a price, and describe your product.  
3. **Browse & Buy** â€“ Explore available items and contact sellers.  
4. **Meet & Exchange** â€“ Arrange a meetup at a designated campus location.
